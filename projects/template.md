> **Instructions**:
> Fill out the name of the project and an email of the person who will be responsible for it, this is the person who will be responsible for splitting up the awarded PKT between the participants. Other project participants may be named or may be pseudo-anonymous as long as there's some means of contact listed.
> You MUST fill the maximum requested PKT contribution, otherwise the Network Steward is unable to
evaluate your project. Note that lower cost projects are ranked more highly.
> The requested hourly rate in national currency is OPTIONAL but will significantly improve the quality
of your proposal and help protect you against decreases in the PKT trading price. You should specify this
for the labor which you are doing on the project.
> The total non-labor cost is OPTIONAL and should only be used if you have justifiable expenses other
than time.

## Success criteria

> **Instructions:** Explain how the Network Steward should evaluate the success or failure of your project as a bullet list. Some examples of criteria might be:
> * Capability of cjdns nodes to interconnect over wifi without any specific configuration
> * 1000 people using yggdrasil

*place success criteria here*

> 1. What new things will be delivered which the Network Steward can use to verify that the milestone was a success?
> 2. How much of the budget should be paid out?
>
> If you have already done work on the project, create *negative* milestones and write success criteria for
> these milestones in order to justify what has already been done.

### Milestone 0 (Kickoff)

> **Instructions:** Document anything which you did on the project before the project began, any prototypes,
> mockups, planning or useful work which was done. This should correspond to the **Pre-project effort**
> defined at the beginning of the document.
>
> Then explain how much PKT must be provided at the beginning of the project. **NOTE:** Projects which ask for larger advances with less pre-project work will be regarded as more risky, for details see the [acceptance_process](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/master/acceptance_process.md).

After the project is accepted, the grantee will make a payment request, declaring the price of PKT at
the time of acceptance and requesting PKT equivilent to *TODO (national currency)*

### Milestone 1

#### Success criteria
> **Instructions**: This is where you write success criteria which will be used for verifying that
milestone 1 was delivered correctly.

#### Payout
In the milestone report, the grantee will include a payment request, declaring the price of PKT at the time of the delivery and requesting PKT equivilant to *TODO (national currency)*.
